# table-layout
Generates plain-text tables from JSON recordset input (array of objects). Useful for presenting text in column layout or data in table layout in text-based user interfaces. Install as a command-line tool or javascript module.

## Install
As a library:

```
$ npm install table-layout --save
```

As a command-line tool:
```
$ npm install -g table-layout
```

## Synopsis

### Command-line tool

Present npm issues from the Github API in table layout: (example requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/))
```sh
$ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/npm/npm/issues \
| jq 'map({ number, title, login:.user.login, comments })' \
| table-layout
```
```

 etc.
```

The Github API data piped into `table-layout` in the above example looks something like this:

```
[
  {
    "number": 10263,
    "title": "npm run start",
    "login": "Slepperpon",
    "comments": 4
  },
  {
    "number": 10262,
    "title": "npm-shrinkwrap.json being ignored for a dependency of a dependency (2.14.9, 3.3.10)",
    "login": "maxkorp",
    "comments": 0
  },
  {
    "number": 10261,
    "title": "EPROTO Error Installing Packages",
    "login": "azkaiart",
    "comments": 2
  },
  etc.
  etc.
]
```

Here's an example of formatting text into columns. This input (one row, two columns):
```json
[
    {
      "column 1": "The Kingdom of Scotland was a state in north-west Europe traditionally said to have been founded in 843, which joined with the Kingdom of England to form a unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Its territories expanded and shrank, but it came to occupy the northern third of the island of Great Britain, sharing a land border to the south with the Kingdom of England. ",
      "column 2": "Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded Soviet Russia along a 2,900 kilometer front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses."
    }
]
```

..piped through `table-layout`:

```sh
$ cat example/two-columns.json | table-layout
```

..generates this output:

```

                                           vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses.
```

Notice the two columns have equal width, this is the default style. You can set specific column widths using `--width`, in this case the "column 2" width is set to 55 characters:

```sh
$ cat example/two-columns.json | table-layout --width "column 2: 55"
```
